# node-practice
Practice project for Node.js. 
I am working on a ChatRoom application using node.js and MongoDB at the server-side(Just to familiarize myself with the 2 technologies).
I have recently added the friend requests feature to the project. 
I am now working on the Group Chat feature. 
Just a brief explanation of the content: the 'bin' folder has a file named 'www' which is the Node server file (server.js). 
The CSS and Client-side JS files are in the 'public' folder. 
The 'routes' folder consists the controllers for the different view files which are in the 'views' folder.
